# What Is Pandas In Python?
Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays. As one of the most popular data wrangling packages, Pandas works well with many other data science modules inside the Python ecosystem.

# Key Features of Pandas

It has a fast and efficient DataFrame object with the default and customized indexing.<br>
Used for reshaping and pivoting of the data sets.<br>
Group by data for aggregations and transformations.<br>
It is used for data alignment and integration of the missing data.<br>
Provide the functionality of Time Series.<br>
Process a variety of data sets in different formats like matrix data, tabular heterogeneous, time series.<br>
Handle multiple operations of the data sets such as subsetting, slicing, filtering, groupBy, re-ordering, and re-shaping.<br>
It integrates with the other libraries such as SciPy, and scikit-learn.

# Benefits of Pandas

Data Representation: It represents the data in a form that is suited for data analysis through its DataFrame and Series.
Clear code: The clear API of the Pandas allows you to focus on the core part of the code. So, it provides clear and concise code for the user.
